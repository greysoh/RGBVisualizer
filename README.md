# RGB Visualizer
A simple, RGB visualizer that serves as a base for more complex visualizations
## Who is this for? 
This is for people who want to make their own visualizer config the easy way. You control all the effects.  
A new project will be coming soon, based on the same code, with everything removed and is controlled using custom JS.  
  
You can control everything. The background renderer, colors, etc.
## Status
- Feature complete
- 100% working on Wallpaper Engine
- 70% working on Lively Wallpaper (visualizer calculations wrong)
## Compilation
Install `Deno` from deno.land, and run tooling\compile\comp.bat to enable lively wallpaper support.  
If you don't want lively wallpaper support, just copy bridgeSrc.js to bridge.js.
